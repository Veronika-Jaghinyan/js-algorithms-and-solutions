# JavaScript Algorithms and Solutions

Welcome to the **JavaScript Algorithms and Solutions** repository! This repository is a collection of JavaScript solutions to various coding challenges and algorithm problems. Each JavaScript file in this repository addresses a specific problem, providing a self-contained solution that is easy to follow and understand.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Practice problem-solving and improve JavaScript skills.
- Document and organize solutions to coding challenges for future reference.
- Provide examples of various algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is contained within its own `.js` file, named after the problem it solves. This helps in keeping the code organized and makes it easy to locate specific solutions.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Veronika-Jaghinyan/js-algorithms-and-solutions.git

2. Navigate to the directory.
   cd js-algorithms-and-solutions

3. Open any .js file to view or edit the solution to a specific problem. And to run the code open a terminal or command prompt in this directory.

4. Run a JavaScript file with Node.js (assuming Node.js is installed on your machine):
   node zigzag-string-transformation.js

   You can replace file name with any .js file name you want to run.
